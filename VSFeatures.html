  <div id="paragraphs"><p><h3>The Hamish Hay Bridge</h3>The Hamish Hay Bridge is the country’s oldest cast iron and stone bridge, and has been standing since 1852. It was also the first bridge to be built across the Avon River, and was originally called the Papanui Bridge or Market Place Bridge. Over the years the bridge has been refurbished and replaced multiple times, but today is known as the Hamish Hay Bridge, named in 1989 after Sir Hamish Hay, Mayor of Christchurch. The bridge also has rails underneath it in commemoration of the 74 years of public tram service in Christchurch from 1880 till 1954.</p>
  <p><h3>Floral Clock</h3>A Floral Clock was presented to Christchurch by Calder MacKay Co. Ltd. In 1953. The clock has 2 hands and is 8.5 metres in diameter, the backing of which is a pattern of 7000 flowers. These flowers are planted in a different design at the beginning of spring and autumn and sits in its own corner of the square in an inviting area.  </p>
  <p><h3>Fountain</h3>Donated in to the city of Christchurch by Henry Layton Bowker, a worker whose land and business were located on Colombo Street next to Victoria Square, Bowker Fountain is the first electric illuminated fountain in Australasia. The idea of the fountain was written into Henry’s last will and testimony, and the money was donated upon his death in 1921. The fountain however took nearly 10 years to be completed and was unveiled in 1931.</p>
  <p><h3>Kanakana Table</h3>The Kanakana Table was designed as a tribute to the area history of being a mahinga kai, and is a place for sharing food positioned next to the boat stop. The table is made of concrete and bronze and contains a depiction of a Kanakana or pouched lamprey (Geotria Australis) alongside a blessing for food. 
The blessing is as follows: Nau mai e ngā hua, e hora nei I hara mai nā koe, I whakatupua nuku, I whakatupua rangi, tāwhia ki a rēhua, ki a tama, kit e ao marama, kia whakairia ki runga.
Kia tina, tina, Haumi e, hui e, tāiki e!</p>
  <p><h3>Poupou</h3>A poupou, placed near to the Kanakana table, was created by carver Riki Manuel for the 1990 Treaty of Waitangi commemorations, and was unveiled in 1994. It is 6 metres tall and carved out of totara, the plaque alongside it reading “He poupou tohu ahi-ka o Ngāi Tahu. A mark of the long burning fires of Ngāi Tahu.” </p>
  <p><h3>Mana Motuhake</h3>The Mana motuhake are a significant acknowledgment of mana whenua of the Ngāi Tahu in the area. They are positioned in the park to be flanking the queen Victoria statue, showing support and aide. They were created by carver Fayne Robinson, and offers a balance between both Maori and Pākehā culture, as well as addressing the significance of the area known as Victoria Square. </p>
  <p><h3>Literary Trail </h3>There are a couple of pepeha around the square, including an extract from Kemps Deed addressing Queen Victoria and reflecting the whakatauki that underpins Te runanga o Ngāi Tahu
“Ko ō mātou kāinga nohoanga, 
ko ā mātou mahinga kai, 
me waiho mārie mō ā mātou tamariki, 
mō muri iho i a mātou.”
There is also a piece commissioned by Fiona Farrell (2015), which directly references the origin of Victoria Square and it’s bicultural significance.
“In the Market Place 
They traded leaves for a song,
Solid ground for a fistful of water.”
</p>
  <p><h3>Parerau</h3>A 40 metre long low basalt wall was installed behind the Queen Victoria statue, with sand blasted illustrations of leaves and seed pods created by Ngāi Tahu artist Jennifer Rendall. This decorative pattern not only symbolises the unity in cultures between Ngāi Tahu and Pākehā threw the land, but acknowledges the significance of the flora to the land.</p>
  <p><h3>Woven Mats</h3>In Victoria Square are 3 pieces designed by artists Morehu Flutey-Henare and Reihana Parata as part of a series of 13. These designs are Nga Whariki Manaaki, or woven welcome mats. The first mat, Mahinga Kai, is significant to the area being used as mahinga kai by the Ngāi Tahu, the design of which incorporates manu, ferns, fish and vegetation. Tai Waiora, or water resources, significant to the coastal region of Christchurch, and is placed on the Hamish Hay Bridge over the Avon River. The third design is Ngā Pou Riri e Iwa – The nine tall tree that made up the Ngāi Tahu claim. It is significant to the eight land purchase agreements between the Crown and the Ngāi Tahu, the ninth grievance of which being the loss of mahinga kai. The pattern incorporates nine tall trees at the bottom, the middle pattern tūhura, signifying the addressing of this topic, and the top pattern whakaaro tahi signifying unity. </p>
  <p><h3>Weeping Willows</h3>A commemorative boulder dedicated to Francois Le Lievre, who came to New Zealand on a whaling ship in 1838, bringing with him willow cuttings from Napoleons grave on the island of St. Helena. He planted these along the Avon River where they continue to grow today.</p>
  <p><h3>Time Capsule</h3>A time capsule was buried on the edge of the square in a flower bed on 5 April 2018 to mark the completion of the restoration of Victoria Square following the 2011 earthquakes. The contents of the capsule were chosen by The Cathedral Grammar School and is planned to be opened in 2081, 200 years after the school opened. The capsule contains letters written by the children about current day, a toy owl (the class mascot), and a modern day cell phone.</p>
